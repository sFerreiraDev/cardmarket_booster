# Cardmarket Booster

This is a very simple extension that helps non advanced MTG Players (I mean the players that don't know what a card does just by it's name) to manage their wanted decks in cardmarket.

I use it to manage the decks that I want, so maybe it might help other people too! =D

Here's a video showing it's features: [Cardmarket Boost Extension](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXx8yjd6QD4)

Any type of sugestion is, not only very encouraged, but also very apreciated! =D

Here's the link to by me a coffee if you feel like it: [Buy me a coffe](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/app/dashboard)

Thank you, hope earing any kind of feedback from you!
